# BMI-Calculator
A web-application that will mail you your BMI and it is an effective way to find out if you're fit or not! 


TO RUN:

Install Flask , flask_alchemy and you need to have postgreSQL installed on your local computer.

If you wish to use this app, please go to send_email.py and use your own email and password in that place!
Also I've commented out the postgreSQL database line. Please add your password and the name of your database in app.py.
